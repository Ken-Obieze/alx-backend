# Caching System

This project implements various caching systems in Python. Each caching system is implemented as a class that inherits from a base caching class. The following caching systems are implemented:

- BasicCache: A basic caching system without any size limit.
- FIFOCache: A caching system that uses the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) algorithm to evict items when the cache is full.
- LIFOCache: A caching system that uses the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) algorithm to evict items when the cache is full.
- LRUCache: A caching system that uses the Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm to evict items when the cache is full.
- MRUCache: A caching system that uses the Most Recently Used (MRU) algorithm to evict items when the cache is full.
- LFUCache: A caching system that uses the Least Frequently Used (LFU) algorithm to evict items when the cache is full.

## Usage

To use any of the caching systems, create an instance of the desired class and use the `put` and `get` methods to store and retrieve items from the cache.

pytho
# Example usage of LRUCache
from lru_cache import LRUCache

# Create an instance of LRUCache
cache = LRUCache()

# Add items to the cache
cache.put("key1", "value1")
cache.put("key2", "value2")
cache.put("key3", "value3")

# Retrieve items from the cache
print(cache.get("key1"))  # Output: value1
print(cache.get("key2"))  # Output: value2
print(cache.get("key3"))  # Output: value3

Python Scripts
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using wc
* All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
* All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
* A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
